<p align="left">To make my concept clearer and keep myself on the full stack track, I decided to practice the exercises sometimes from this course with other studies like cloud and data analytics. The idea is to keep my previous knowledge in tune and add something new knowledge from this course that I haven’t learned yet or missed before. This course is well-structured and updated, followed the steps of learning one after another in an organized way and is full of useful information. I’m considering this course as a one-stop container for beginners to kick-start.</p>
